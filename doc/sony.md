## Hardware specification

Sony multi terminal USB is a custom USB connector with Sony defined pins based on a micro USB connector.

Micro USB part is same as the standard micro USB pin definition. Note that A5 is the GND.

Sony pin part's definition is here:

(Look from the connector side) from right to left is 1-10:
- 1: Power on/off (triggerd by shorting to ground)
- 2: GND (without circuit it's NC)
- 3: Video out
- 4: Audio L out
- 5: Audio R out
- 6: Select (for remote use case there should be a 100k resistor against to GND)
- 7: UART_TX
- 8: UART_RX
- 9: NC
- 10: 3V3

UART with:
- RS232
- 9600 baud rate
- 8 bits per byte
- 1 stop bit
- EVEN parity
- LSB first
- Big endian
- ASCII format

## Communication mode

- Begin with a symbol [``#``, ``$``, ``%``, ``&``], followed by some data, ending with ``*``.
    - ``#``: (Remote -> Camera) Command
    - ``$``: (Camera -> Remote) Command ACK
    - ``%``: (Camera -> Remote) Detect Message?
    - ``&``: (Remote -> Camera) Detect Message ACK?


### Power up

When the remote board was plugged in, the voltage on UART lines will be pulled to high level (3.3V). After around 323ms, the camera will send a ``%000*`` command to the remote board. The remote board should send a ``&00080*`` confirmation back to the camera 10ms after receiving the ``%000*`` command.

- Power up
- (323ms) (which means the remote must finish initialization after UART configured within 300ms)
- Camera: ``%000*``
- (10ms)
- Remote: ``&00080*``

### Handshake

Same as above, camera send ``%000*`` command to remote board. The remote board should send a ``&00080*`` confirmation back to the camera 10ms after receiving the ``%000*`` command.

- Camera: ``%000*``
- (10ms)
- Remote: ``&00080*``

### Record

Start recording from remote:

- remote: ``#7100*`` (button pressed)
- camera: ``$71000*``
- remote: ``#7110*`` (button released)
- camera: ``$71100*``
- 10ms
- camera: ``%7610*`` (recording)
- 10ms
- remote: ``&76100*`` (recording ack)

during recording

- camera: ``%7610*`` (recording)
- remote: ``&76100*`` (recording ack)

Stop recording from remote:

- remote: ``#7100*`` (button pressed)
- camera: ``$71000*``
- remote: ``#7110*`` (button released)
- camera: ``$71100*``
- 10ms
- camera: ``%7600*`` (stopped)
- 9ms (I don't know why)
- remote: ``&76000*`` (stopped ack)

If start recording from the camera, which means you press the "record" button on the camera, the camera will send two message to the remote board:

- camera: ``%7610*`` (recording)
- 10ms
- remote: ``&76100*`` (recording ack)

- camera: ``%7600*`` (stopped)
- 9ms (I don't know why)
- remote: ``&76000*`` (stopped ack)
