Flowshutter is a custom camera remote. When used in conjunction with readily available hardware, this results in a flexible and reliable external camera motion logger for Gyroflow. It can provide precise synchronization of camera video recording and motion logger (betaflight/emuflight FC) recording. 

It was designed to be used with the [Gyroflow](https://github.com/gyroflow/gyroflow) software to provide you one of the best open source video stabilization experiences.


## Features

Flowshutter has the following features:

- '1-click' - (1) start/stop camera recording and (2) arm/disarm FC, via one click 
- Camera recording start/stop control
- FC arm/disarm control
- OLED display

with many more features on the way!

## Supported Hardware

Flowshutter haven't worked with any manufacturer yet. So there's no "Ready-to-Use" commercial hardware/product yet.

However you can try to build an official design from us at your own! The community [credit card sized design](https://oshwhub.com/AirFleet/xiang-ji-kong-zhi-ban) and [FC sized design](https://oshwhub.com/AirFleet/xiang-ji-kong-zhi-ban_copy_copy) are already open-sourced. Check out our [Build Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELaQPYE9ncA)!

### Compatible camera protocol/trigger mechanisms

- [x] Sony Multiport USB protocol
- [] Sony LANC protocol (WIP)
- [] Canon shutter wire (WIP)
- [] Nikon protocol (WIP)
- [] Others are on the way

### Compatible FC

FC is short for flight controller, more specifically with betaflight/emuflight running on.

- flowbox (highly recommended)
- modern FC with BMI270 gyroscope (recommended)
- any other FC that support CRSF protocol

## Development Guide
### Flash micropython firmware

The micropython firmware we used is [v1.18](https://micropython.org/resources/firmware/esp32-20220117-v1.18.bin), You can find a copy in the `/tools` directory. Also, a `uPyCraft` windows version is also provided in the `/tools` directory. You can try to use that to flash your ESP32 without the help of ESP-idf.

### Set up environment

`Visual Studio Code` with `Pymakr` extension is recommended.

1. Install `Visual Studio Code`
2. Install `node`
3. Install `Pymakr` extension in `Visual Studio Code`
4. Edit `Pymakr`'s global settings that add `"wch.cn",` to `"autoconnect_comport_manufacturers"`
5. Modify content of `"address"` to `"address": "",`
6. Pull flowshutter code from `https://github.com/gyroflow/flowshutter`
7. Then you can connect and upload the flowshutter code
